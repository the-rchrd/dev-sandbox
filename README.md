—i'm @the-rchrd— ~here i'm resolving & testing some problems using c++ language~

For example, problem of Finding Most Coommoon Symbol In String / Text. I wrote three types of fucntion's, that resolve that problem, let's see if we pass million symbols in functions:
    1) ~too much time / not even ended~ O(N^2) complexity — Two Cycles Method —
    2) ~execution time: 502ms~ O(K*N) complexity — Unordered Set Method —
    3) ~execution time: 125ms~ O(N) complexity — Unordered Map Mepthod —
    
So we see, that our ideal point is to find solution, that will fit into O(N) complexity, so this repository is about seeing difference & try different solutions of resolving problems.

~here i'm also resolving some problems from LeetCode & Codeforces~
