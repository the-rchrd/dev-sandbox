# Dev — Sandbox
—here i'm testing &amp; studying some features of c++ language—

For example:

    — Problem of Finding Most Coommoon Symbol In String / Text —

    I wrote three types of fucntion's, that resolve that problem, let's see if we pass million symbols in functions:
        1) ~too much time / not even ended~ O(N^2) complexity — Two Cycles Method —
        2) ~execution time: 502ms~ O(K*N) complexity — Unordered Set Method —
        3) ~execution time: 125ms~ O(N) complexity — Unordered Map Mepthod —
    
    So we see, that our ideal point is to find solution, that will fit into O(N) complexity, so this repository is about seeing difference & try different solutions of resolving problems.
